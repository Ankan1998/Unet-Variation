# <p align = "center"> Unet-Variation </p>
This repo is created to implement variation of UNET architecture in pytorch. Original UNET from paper by 
Ronneberger et al is not implemented. Modern variation of Unet which has same segmentation mask as of input image is the base architecture

### TODO
* [x] Unet (Modern Variation)
* [x] Attention UNET
* [ ] Residual Unet
  * [x] Residual Block
* [ ] Residual Attention Unet
* [ ] Recurrent Residual Unet
* [ ] Recurrent Residual Attention Unet
